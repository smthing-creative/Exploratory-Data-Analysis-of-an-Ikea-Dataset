# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-an-Ikea-Dataset

This jupyter notebook is a replica from an assignment I submitted during my Master's program Data Driven Design.
Goal: Perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this ikea dataset by:
- analyzing its structure and content
- performn advanced data cleaning
- looking for insightful patterns and relationships
- visualizing said patterns and/or relationships

Inquiry Guiding Questions:
- What dataset have you chosen to work with and why did you select it?
- What do the data represent?
- What patterns, trends, or insights did you discover during your exploratory data analysis?
- How can you visualize these patterns?
- What challenges did you face during the data cleaning and exploration process and how did you overcome them?
